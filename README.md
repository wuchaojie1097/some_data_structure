what can segment tree do:  // https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html 

  1.Finding the maximum and the number of times it appears
  
  2.Compute the greatest common divisor / least common multiple
  
  3.Counting the number of zeros, searching for the k-th zero
  
  4.Searching for an array prefix with a given amount
  
  5.Searching for the first element greater than a given amount
  
  6.Finding subsegments with the maximal sum
  
  7.Saving the entire subarrays in each vertex
  
  8.Find the smallest number greater or equal to a specified number. No modification queries.
  
  9.Find the smallest number greater or equal to a specified number. With modification queries.
  
  10.Find the smallest number greater or equal to a specified number. Acceleration with "fractional cascading".
  
  11.Range updates (Lazy Propagation)

  11.1 Addition on segments

  11.2 Assignment on segments

  11.3 Adding on segments, querying for maximum

  12.Generalization to higher dimensions

  13.Preserving the history of its values (Persistent Segment Tree)
  
  14.Finding the k-th smallest number in a range

  15.Implicit segment tree
